# MWCL: Memory-driven and mapping alignment  for radiology Reports
br
#Highlight
Existing methods struggle with biased visual-textual representations and inefficient cross-modal interactions, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained medical abnormalities. To address these challenges, we introduce memory-driven  (MWCL), a radiology report generation model that leverages weighted contrastive learning for feature refinement and memory-driven alignment for contextual consistency. Our approach improves abnormality recognition and strengthens the alignment between image and text representations.
